# Landing pages

We have a number of landing pages. They provide structured, top-level "categories" and serve two
primary goals:
- Well-defined, indexable pages for search engines (SEO) in the XML sitemap
- Ambient findability for jobseekers landing on the home page and "just browsing"

There are two kinds of landing pages:
- Location-based (one for every `LocationPolygon` in the database)
- Custom (defined in `config/landing_pages.yml`)

## Location-based landing pages

TODO: Fill in

## Custom landing pages

These are configured through YAML and can have arbitrary criteria
